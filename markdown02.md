# Learning Markdown - Reflection (Blog Article)

# Question 1: What is Markdown?

Markdown is a set of rules and text used to write documentation.


# Question 2: Why do we use Markdown?

Writing documentation is extremely important and useful for software development.
Markdown is the exact syntax and characters that we use to write that specific documentation.

For example: A software engineer uses markdown to write documentation and a data scientist uses markdown to write Jupyter notebooks.

# Question 3: What symbol will create a heading in markdown?

The hashtag symbol # is what we use to create headings in Markdown.

One single hashtag will create the larget heading.

For example: # This will create the largest heading.

On the other hand, 6 hashtags will create the smallest heading.

For example: ###### These 6 hashtags will create the smallest heading.

# Question 4: When making the text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?

It is best practice to use the ** at the beginning and end of a word or sentence that you want to make bold.

However, one single * at the beginning and end of the word or sentence will turn the text into italics.

On the other hand, 3 asterisks at the begining and end of a word or sentence; will turn your text into bold and italics at the same time.

# Question 5: How do you create a link with Markdown?

In order to create a link in Markdown we use the symbols [ ] and ( )

For example: ### My Site Was Built Using [Github Pages](https://manuel-marquez1.github.io/reading-notes/)

The text inside [ ] provides the text that will be displayed and the link inside ( ) will embed the link into the text that is inside the [].

# Question 6: What are three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?

The three signs thatwe can use to create bulletpoints / unordered lists are...

The minus sign (-), the asterisks singn (*), and the plus sign (+).

+ This is part of an un ordered list
* This is part of the same unordered list
- This is part of the same unordered listÂ 

Hope this helps!!!ðŸ˜Š
