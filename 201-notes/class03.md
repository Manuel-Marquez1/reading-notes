# Class 03: Lists, The Box Model, and Loops

# Notes from Class 03
You can turn the career assingments until the last day of class. Just make sure that you submit them at the end.

In class we also had a code review.

We also reviewed the "use strict" line of code.

As well as concepts such as **alert()** and use of **string template literal**.

**Functions:** A way to execute statements.

**Objects** A function is an object. Pretty much everything in Javascript is an object.

**.loLowerCase()** this method stores the data in lowercase even if the informattion provided was in uppercase.

We learned about **control floww**. However, we will later learn about how to respond to events and the usage of the DOM.

We learned about how to code **increments / score keepers**.

At the beginning of the class, we also have a good example on how to clone Github repos.

# Arrays

They are another **Datatype & Data Structure**.
Their data type is an **Object**.
They are a collection / list of elements.
You can store numbers, strings, lists, etc all in the same array.
You do not have to determine the size of your array upon creation.
They are indexed based. Every element has a position.

```javascript
//                0         1        2      3
let myArray = ["Hello", "goodbye", "hi", "bye"];
```

# Read Class 03

# Learn HTML

1. When should you use unordered lists in your HTML document?

You should use **unordered lists** when the order does not matter. For example, when we are mentioning random information like names of differents bands, colors, dog breeds, etc.

2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

# Learn CSS

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

# Learn Javascript

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?

2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

 const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];

3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

```
 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;
```


5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
