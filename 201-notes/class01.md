# Getting Started

## Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers

Our browser send a request to the server. The server returns to us all the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that will form our website. The files are returned to us "The client" and are displayed as a website.

## Describe how HTML,CSS, and Js files are "parsed" in the browser.

The browser recognizes the **<link>** elements on every CSS file.
Once the browser has parsed the HTML file (initial file) with our CSS file - it sends a request to the server for any CSS files with a **<link>** element.

Last but no least, the browser does the same with Javascript files. The browser recognizes Js files due to the **< script >** element.
