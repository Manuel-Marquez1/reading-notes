# What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

There are so many features that a text editor could have. 
These four features are the most important to me.

1. Emmet

As developers, it is not only important to develop high-quality features.
But it is also important to save time whenever we code.
Emmet can not only help us build the boiler plate of our HTML files faster, but it will also allow us to build the structure of our website at a faster rate.

2. Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting allows us to easily distinguish the different aspects of our code.
It allows us to vizually identify...
- comments
- modules (specially when importing modules)
- bugs / errors or syntax mistakes located on our code

Syntax highlighting is a great time-saving tool!

3. Themes

When I first started coding - I fell in love with the Atom code editor.
Sure, it was a code editor like any other. However, it's unique theme style made coding a visually enjoying experience.
By December 15th of 2022 - Atom passed away ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.

However, later on I learned that VS Code had a theme just like the one Atom had - this not only made my coding journey more enjoyable, but my faith in humanity was restored!

4. Extenssions

Extensions were created to make our lives easier.
As software developers, it is important to constantly learn about extenssions.
Each extenssion accompanies a certain goal...

- Some extenssions give you useful features like **live-server**.
  Live-server allows you to visualize the changes that you make to your website.
- Some other extenssions give you beautiful themes.
  The **Atom** extenssion allowed me to have the theme of my favorite text editor - Atom.

  

# What do the following commands do? 
pwd - This is the Print Working Directory. This command lets you know exsactly which file or directory you are currently in.
It is also known as the **The you are HERE command**.
ls - This is our list command. It shows you a list of the directories that we have.
cd - This command is very straight forward it allows us to **change directory**.
mkdir - This command allows us to create a new file on our computer.

~~~ folder_name mkdir file_name ~~~ 

touch - This command allows us to update access of our directories.

# Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

cd projects
mkdir new-project
touch new-project/newfile.md
cd ..
ls projects/new-project
