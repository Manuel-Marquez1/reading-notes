# Class 04 Structured Web Pages with HTML


# What is HTML and how do we use it?

HTML stand for Hyper Text Markup Language

HTML is like the skeleton of our website.

A website is like a human being. It has a skeleton, flesh, and movement.

In this case, HTML is the skeleton / structure of our website.

# What are the 3 main parts of an HTML document?

The first part is the **opening tag** which goes at the beginning.

The second part is the **closing tag** which goes at the end.

Last but not least, we have the **content** which goes in the middle of the opening and closing tag.

# What is it called when you give an element extra information?

**Attributes** is what we use to provide extra information to our HTML elements

Some popular attributes are...

**href** we use href to add a link to HTML tags such as images.

**id** We use id, when we want to give an alias to a line of code. Later, we use that very same id to modify the design using tools like CSS.

**class** does the very same thing as **id**. However, we use class when we want to modify bigger chunks/sections of HTML.

# What is semantic HTML.
Semantic HTML is like any other HTML boilerplate that we have seen before.

However, the syntax that we find when working with semantic HTML is more straightforward.

Due to the fact, that it allows us to quickly identify...

1. <head> Upper part
2. <main> Main content
3. <footer> Lower partMore notes will go in here!
