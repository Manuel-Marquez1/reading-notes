# What is Version Control?
Version control is software that allows us to **track versions** of our software.
There are so many version control software out there. However, at Code Fellows, we use Git.

# What is cloning in Git?
Cloning is a process where we take our code from Github, and make a copy of it / clone it on VS Code.

This allows us to write our code on a code editor, and then we can push the changes back to Github using Git.

# What is the command to track and stage files?
The command **git add** is the command that allows us to command and stage files.
You can type **git add name_of_the_file** to commit file by file.
Or, you can also type **git add .** to track and stage **ALL** of your files.

# What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?
**git commit** is the command that we use to take a snapshot of our files.
Snapshots allow us to track the changes that we have done on previous versions.
Once the snapshot has been taken - we are ready to push the changes back to Github!!!
What is the command to send your changed files to Github?

# What is the command to send your changed files to Github?
In order to send our changes back to Github, we use the **git push** command-
Pushing your code with the **git push command** is really the last step of the process.
The command will send our new version of the code back to Github.More notes will go in here!
