# Class 05: Cascading Style Sheets


# What is the purpose of CSS?

The purpose of CSS is to style our HTML webpage.

Think about a car...

The metal is the structure - HTML
The color that goes over the metal is the CSS.
The functions that the car is able to perfor thanks to the engine is the Javascript code!!!

# Three ways of inserting CSS in your project

+ External stylesheet (very popular)
+ In-line (Not the best practice)
+ Internal (It goes inside the HTML code itself)

# Write a CSS rule that will give all the <p> elements red text

p {
    color: red;
}

**P** is the selector
**color** is the property
**red** is the value of the propertyMore notes will go in here!
