# Introduction

Hey there!

My name is ManueL...
I live in Mexico City with my dog Rex. 
I love learning from Udemy courses (I have over 60 of them) ðŸ˜©

In 2020, I was attending college in Seattle as an international student and heard about the world of coding bootcamps.
As I grew in my career, it became abvious that I was going to need more technical skills.

In 2021, I moved back to my home country, changed my major to data science and tried to gain as many technical skills as I could.
Nowadays, Im an executive at a couple of nonprofits and work as a consultant.

My dream is to create the very first nonprofit coding school in Mexico and serve the people of my country by providing free CS education.

Here is a list of my favorite sandwishes...

+ The philly
+ The cucumber sandwish with cream cheese (originally from the UK)
+ The BLT

# Growth mindset in my own words

I like calling growth mindset - the mindset of **Yet**.

For example: LetÂ´s replace the following sentence...

`IÂ´m bad at coding`.

Now, we will replace it with...

`Im not bad at coding. I just do not understand it yet.`



# Three reminders on how to keep a growth mindset

+ Understand that you do not know things **yet** , but you will get them later. 
+ Always tell yourself that _you can always improve_.
+ Always understand that failure is part of the process

# Learning Markdown - Reflection (Blog Article)

Question 1: What is Markdown?

Markdown is a set of rules and text used to write documentation.


Question 2: Why do we use Markdown?

Writing documentation is extremely important and useful for software development.
Markdown is the exact syntax and characters that we use to write that specific documentation.

For example: A software engineer uses markdown to write documentation and a data scientist uses markdown to write Jupyter notebooks.

Question 3: What symbol will create a heading in markdown?

The hashtag symbol # is what we use to create headings in Markdown.

One single hashtag will create the larget heading.

For example: # This will create the largest heading.

On the other hand, 6 hashtags will create the smallest heading.

For example: ###### These 6 hashtags will create the smallest heading.

Question 4: When making the text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?

It is best practice to use the ** at the beginning and end of a word or sentence that you want to make bold.

However, one single * at the beginning and end of the word or sentence will turn the text into italics.

Question 5: How do you create a link with Markdown?

In order to create a link in Markdown we use the symbols [] and ()

For example: ### My Site Was Built Using [Github Pages](https://manuel-marquez1.github.io/reading-notes/)

The text inside [] provides the text that will be displayed and the link inside () will embed the link into the text that is inside the [].

Question 6: What are three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?

The three signs thatwe can use to create bulletpoints / unordered lists are...

The minus sign (-), the asterisks singn (*), and the plus sign (+).

Hope this helps!!!ðŸ˜Š
