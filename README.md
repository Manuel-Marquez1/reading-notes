# Introduction

Hey there!

My name is ManueL...
I live in Mexico City with my dog Rex. 
I love learning from Udemy courses (I have over 60 of them) ðŸ˜©

In 2020, I attended college in Seattle as an international student and heard about the world of coding bootcamps.
As I grew in my career, it became obvious that I was going to need more technical skills.

In 2021, I moved back to my home country, changed my major to data science, and tried to gain as many technical skills as I could.
Nowadays, I'm an executive at a couple of nonprofits and work as a consultant.

My dream is to create the very first nonprofit coding school in Mexico and serve the people of my country by providing free CS education.

Here is a list of my favorite sandwiches...

+ The Philly
+ The cucumber sandwich with cream cheese (originally from the UK)
+ The BLT

# What is Version Control?
Version control is software that allows us to **track versions** of our software.
There are so many version control software out there. However, at Code Fellows, we use Git.

# What is cloning in Git?
Cloning is a process where we take our code from Github, and make a copy of it / clone it on VS Code.

This allows us to write our code on a code editor, and then we can push the changes back to Github using Git.

# What is the command to track and stage files?
The command **git add** is the command that allows us to command and stage files.
You can type **git add name_of_the_file** to commit file by file.
Or, you can also type **git add .** to track and stage **ALL** of your files.

# What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?
**git commit** is the command that we use to take a snapshot of our files.
Snapshots allow us to track the changes that we have done on previous versions.
Once the snapshot has been taken - we are ready to push the changes back to Github!!!
What is the command to send your changed files to Github?

# What is the command to send your changed files to Github?
In order to send our changes back to Github, we use the **git push** command-
Pushing your code with the **git push command** is really the last step of the process.
The command will send our new version of the code back to Github.

# What is HTML and how do we use it?

HTML stand for Hyper Text Markup Language

HTML is like the skeleton of our website.

A website is like a human being. It has a skeleton, flesh, and movement.

In this case, HTML is the skeleton / structure of our website.

# What are the 3 main parts of an HTML document?

The first part is the **opening tag** which goes at the beginning.

The second part is the **closing tag** which goes at the end.

Last but not least, we have the **content** which goes in the middle of the opening and closing tag.

# What is it called when you give an element extra information?

**Attributes** is what we use to provide extra information to our HTML elements

Some popular attributes are...

**href** we use href to add a link to HTML tags such as images.

**id** We use id, when we want to give an alias to a line of code. Later, we use that very same id to modify the design using tools like CSS.

**class** does the very same thing as **id**. However, we use class when we want to modify bigger chunks/sections of HTML.

# What is semantic HTML.
Semantic HTML is like any other HTML boilerplate that we have seen before.

However, the syntax that we find when working with semantic HTML is more straightforward.

Due to the fact, that it allows us to quickly identify...

1. <head> Upper part
2. <main> Main content
3. <footer> Lower part

# What is the purpose of CSS?

The purpose of CSS is to style our HTML webpage.

Think about a car...

The metal is the structure - HTML
The color that goes over the metal is the CSS.
The functions that the car is able to perfor thanks to the engine is the Javascript code!!!

# Three ways of inserting CSS in your project

+ External stylesheet (very popular)
+ In-line (Not the best practice)
+ Internal (It goes inside the HTML code itself)

# Write a CSS rule that will give all the <p> elements red text

p {
    color: red;
}

**P** is the selector
**color** is the property
**red** is the value of the property

Hope this helps!!!

## What are variable in Javascript?

Variables are a container of data.
Many times when working with data, we need to find ways to manipulate big chunck of data.

Variables allow us to **store** our data

For example:

> var x = 5345.00000;

It would be very tideous to have to type 5345.00000 everytime I need to use it.

However, the variable **x** already stored the same value.

That way, I can just type...

> console.log(x)

Rather than having to code...

console.log(5345.00000)

# What does it mean to **declare** a variable?

In Javascript, declaring a variable is the same as **creating** a variable.
Once the variable has been created, we give it meaning by assigning a bariable.

**Here are 3 ways for declaring a variable**

const price = 45;
let price = 45;
var price = 45;

# What is an assingment operator, and what does it do?

Assingment operators assign values to variables.

let person = "Manuel";

In this case, the equals sign is the **assingment operator**. Because, it is **assigning** a value of Manuel to the variable person.

Now, if i console.log(person)

The output will be whatever was **assigned**. In thi case, it was the string value of Manuel.

# What is information received from the user called?

Information received from the user is called **input**.

Some people, also call it  **prompt**.

LetÂ´s say that you want to get some money from your local ATM.

Most ATM machines are programmed with C/C++ code. However, letÂ´s say that we want the ATM to ask the following questions...

**Insert your NIP**
**How much money you want to withdraw?**

The user goes ahead and will **input** the nip and the desired amount.
We call that information - user input.

## What is control flow?

Control flow is the order that the computer follows in order to execute a statement in a script.

The computer executes the code from top to bottom. Unless something changes the structure - loops and conditionals may affect control flow.

# What is a Javascript function?

A function is a set of instructions that perform a task.
Functions take and input and return an output, but there needs to be a relationship between  the input and the output.

Functions were created with the purpose of making our code re-usable.

## Example of a function

function divide_by_one (number) {
    return number / 1;
}

## We can also write a function using the following method

const divide = function (number){
    return number / 1;
};

## What does it mean to **invoke** or **call** a function?
Invoking a function means. Executing the function as soon as it is defined.

**For example**

(favNumber = function (num = 3){
    console.log("Your favorite number is" + num);
}

favNumber(5) <-- I am invoking my function again and passing a new argument

## What are the parenthesis for when you define the function?

The parenthesis are used to type our **parameters** or default values that we want our function to pass / have.

The parameter(s) inside the parenthesis allows us to pass data. 
For example: Any input that the user wants us to accept. 

**For example** The password to the userÂ´s Netflix account.

## What is an expression in javascript?
An expression is a mix of operators, variables, values, etc.
However, they all evaluate to a single value.

**For example:**

 + > 17 + 9
 + > "Hello there!"
 + > hello.length

# Why would we use a loop in our code?

We use loops in order to perform actions over and over and over again.
Loops does this by **iterating** - which means that the loop will check each and every condition and it will stop until the condition becomes **False**.


# When does a for loop stop executing?

For loops understand booleans.
This means, that if a condition is **True** the for loop will continue working.
However, if at some point, the condition returns **False** the for loop will stop.

The **break** statement will also stop a loop from continuing to execute.


# How many times will a while loop execute?

A while loop will continue working as long as / **while** a condition is **True**.
However, once a condition returns **False** or encounters a **break** statement - the loop will stop working at that point.
