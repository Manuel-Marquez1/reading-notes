# Introduction

Hey there!

My name is ManueL...
I live in Mexico City with my dog Rex. 
I love learning from Udemy courses (I have over 60 of them) ðŸ˜©

In 2020, I was attending college in Seattle as an international student and heard about the world of coding bootcamps.
As I grew in my career, it became abvious that I was going to need more technical skills.

In 2021, I moved back to my home country, changed my major to data science and tried to gain as many technical skills as I could.
Nowadays, Im an executive at a couple of nonprofits and work as a consultant.

My dream is to create the very first nonprofit coding school in Mexico and serve the people of my country by providing free CS education.

Here is a list of my favorite sandwishes...

+ The philly
+ The cucumber sandwish with cream cheese (originally from the UK)
+ The BLT

# Growth mindset in my own words

I like calling growth mindset - the mindset of **Yet**.

For example: LetÂ´s replace the following sentence...

`IÂ´m bad at coding`.

Now, we will replace it with...

`Im not bad at coding. I just do not understand it yet.`



# Three reminders on how to keep a growth mindset

+ Understand that you do not know things **yet** , but you will get them later. 
+ Always tell yourself that _you can always improve_.
+ Always understand that failure is part of the process

# Learning Markdown - Reflection (Blog Article)

# Question 1: What is Markdown?

Markdown is a set of rules and text used to write documentation.


# Question 2: Why do we use Markdown?

Writing documentation is extremely important and useful for software development.
Markdown is the exact syntax and characters that we use to write that specific documentation.

For example: A software engineer uses markdown to write documentation and a data scientist uses markdown to write Jupyter notebooks.

# Question 3: What symbol will create a heading in markdown?

The hashtag symbol # is what we use to create headings in Markdown.

One single hashtag will create the larget heading.

For example: # This will create the largest heading.

On the other hand, 6 hashtags will create the smallest heading.

For example: ###### These 6 hashtags will create the smallest heading.

# Question 4: When making the text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?

It is best practice to use the ** at the beginning and end of a word or sentence that you want to make bold.

However, one single * at the beginning and end of the word or sentence will turn the text into italics.

On the other hand, 3 asterisks at the begining and end of a word or sentence; will turn your text into bold and italics at the same time.

***Just like this one***

# Question 5: How do you create a link with Markdown?

In order to create a link in Markdown we use the symbols [ ] and ( )

For example: ### My Site Was Built Using [Github Pages](https://manuel-marquez1.github.io/reading-notes/)

The text inside [ ] provides the text that will be displayed and the link inside ( ) will embed the link into the text that is inside the [].

# Question 6: What are three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?

The three signs thatwe can use to create bulletpoints / unordered lists are...

The minus sign (-), the asterisks singn (*), and the plus sign (+).

+ This is part of an un ordered list
* This is part of the same unordered list
- This is part of the same unordered listÂ 

Hope this helps!!!ðŸ˜Š

# Reflection 03

# What is Version Control?
Version control is software that allows us to **track versions** of our software.
There are so many version control software out there. However, at Code Fellows, we use Git.

# What is cloning in Git?
Cloning is a process where we take our code from Github, and make a copy of it / clone it on VS Code.

This allows us to write our code on a code editor, and then we can push the changes back to Github using Git.

# What is the command to track and stage files?
The command **git add** is the command that allows us to command and stage files.
You can type **git add name_of_the_file** to commit file by file.
Or, you can also type **git add .** to track and stage **ALL** of your files.

# What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?
**git commit** is the command that we use to take a snapshot of our files.
Snapshots allow us to track the changes that we have done on previous versions.
Once the snapshot has been taken - we are ready to push the changes back to Github!!!
What is the command to send your changed files to Github?

# What is the command to send your changed files to Github?
In order to send our changes back to Github, we use the **git push** command-
Pushing your code with the **git push command** is really the last step of the process.
The command will send our new version of the code back to Github.

# What is HTML and how do we use it?

HTML stand for Hyper Text Markup Language

HTML is like the skeleton of our website.

A website is like a human being. It has a skeleton, flesh, and movement.

In this case, HTML is the skeleton / structure of our website.

# What are the 3 main parts of an HTML document?

The first part is the **opening tag** which goes at the beginning.

The second part is the **closing tag** which goes at the end.

Last but not least, we have the **content** which goes in the middle of the opening and closing tag.

# What is it called when you give an element extra information?

**Attributes** is what we use to provide extra information to our HTML elements

Some popular attributes are...

**href** we use href to add a link to HTML tags such as images.

**id** We use id, when we want to give an alias to a line of code. Later, we use that very same id to modify the design using tools like CSS.

**class** does the very same thing as **id**. However, we use class when we want to modify bigger chunks / sections of HTML.

# What is semantic HTML.
Semantic HTML is like any other HTML boilerplate that we have seen before.

However, the syntax that we find when working with semantic HTML is more straightfoward.

Due to the fact, that it allows us to quickly identify...

1. <head> Upper part
2. <main> Main content
3. <footer> Lower part


# Reading notes October 24th.

# What is the purpose of CSS?

The purpose of CSS is to style our HTML webpage.

Think about a car...

The metal is the structure - HTML
The color that goes over the metal is the CSS.
The functions that the car is able to perfor thanks to the engine is the Javascript code!!!

# Three ways of inserting CSS in your project

+ External stylesheet (very popular)
+ In-line (Not the best practice)
+ Internal (It goes inside the HTML code itself)

# Write a CSS rule that will give all the <p> elements red text

p {
    color: red;
}

**P** is the selector
**color** is the property
**red** is the value of the property

Hope this helps!!!
