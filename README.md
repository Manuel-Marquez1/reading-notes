# Growth Mindset in my own Words

I like calling growth mindset - the mindset of **Yet**.

For example: Let´s replace the following sentence...

`I´m bad at coding`.

Now, we will replace it with...

`Im not bad at coding. I just do not understand it yet.`



# Three reminders on how to keep a Growth Mindset

+ Understans that you do now know things **yet** , but I will get them later.
+ Always tell yourself that _you can always improve_.
+ Always understand that failure is part of the process
