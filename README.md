# Introduction

Hey there!

My name is ManueL...
I live in Mexico City with my dog Rex. 
I love learning from Udemy courses (I have over 60 of them) ðŸ˜©

In 2020, I attended college in Seattle as an international student and heard about the world of coding bootcamps.
As I grew in my career, it became obvious that I was going to need more technical skills.

In 2021, I moved back to my home country, changed my major to data science, and tried to gain as many technical skills as I could.
Nowadays, I'm an executive at a couple of nonprofits and work as a consultant.

My dream is to create the very first nonprofit coding school in Mexico and serve the people of my country by providing free CS education.

Here is a list of my favorite sandwiches...

+ The Philly
+ The cucumber sandwich with cream cheese (originally from the UK)
+ The BLT
