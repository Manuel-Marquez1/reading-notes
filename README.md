# Introduction

Hey there!

My name is ManueL...
I live in Mexico City with my dog Rex. 
I love learning from Udemy courses (I have over 60 of them) ðŸ˜©

In 2020, I was attending college in Seattle as an international student and heard about the world of coding bootcamps.
As I grew in my career, it became abvious that I was going to need more technical skills.

In 2021, I moved back to my home country, changed my major to data science and tried to gain as many technical skills as I could.
Nowadays, Im an executive at a couple of nonprofits and work as a consultant.

My dream is to create the very first nonprofit coding school in Mexico and serve the people of my country by providing free CS education.

Here is a list of my favorite sandwishes...

+ The philly
+ The cucumber sandwish with cream cheese (originally from the UK)
+ The BLT

# Growth Mindset in my own Words

I like calling growth mindset - the mindset of **Yet**.

For example: LetÂ´s replace the following sentence...

`IÂ´m bad at coding`.

Now, we will replace it with...

`Im not bad at coding. I just do not understand it yet.`



# Three reminders on how to keep a Growth Mindset

+ Understand that you do not know things **yet** , but you will get them later. 
+ Always tell yourself that _you can always improve_.
+ Always understand that failure is part of the process
